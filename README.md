A real-life shopping cart application built with React/Typescript/Vitest.

The header component which is auto-shrinkable contains the application's logo on the left side, which is clickable and points to the product list page
The application's cart widget, which represents a cart icon with a number, signifying the count of the products added in the cart
The logic of the quantifier component allows to add as many items as the user wants, but if the user decreases the count to zero, the product will be removed from the cart
The footer component displays social media links and copyright info, as well as the current version of the application

The Shopping Cart consists of two pages: the product list page and the cart page

1. 1. The product list page is responsive and lists all available products, displaying each product's thumbnail image, title, price and a button for adding it to the cart
2. The cart page lists all products that are added to the cart, displaying each product's thumbnail image, title and an option for updating the desired quantity

Possible Improvements
1. Adding item price in the cart page for better visibility
2. Small animations to improve the UX.
3. Add options for registering and login, and saving choices for later
4. Adding rating system where user can rate each product
5. Adding option for leaving comments/reviews
